## Project Title
AI-Powered Communication Optimization Between Earth and Deep Space Probes

## Description
This project explores a conceptual AI solution for optimizing communication between deep space probes and Earth. The proposed system uses AI to:
Prioritize data (example, emergency signals vs. science data)
- Manage bandwidth under changing conditions
- Predict signal strength and optimize transmission timing

The goal is to improve the reliability, efficiency, and safety of deep space communications for NASA missions.
