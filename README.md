## Project Title
AI-Powered Communication Optimization Between Earth and Deep Space Probes

## Description
This project explores a conceptual AI solution for optimizing communication between deep space probes and Earth. The proposed system uses AI to:
Prioritize data (example, emergency signals vs. science data)
- Manage bandwidth under changing conditions
- Predict signal strength and optimize transmission timing

The goal is to improve the reliability, efficiency, and safety of deep space communications for NASA missions.

**Implementation Track - ITAI 2372**  
**Project Title:** AI-Powered Communication Optimization Between Earth and Deep Space Probes  
**Student Name:** Williane Yarro
Instructir Name: Anna Rachapudi



## üìò Project Overview

This project simulates an AI system that prioritizes communication between a deep space probe and Earth.
It intelligently manages limitedbandwidth by deciding which data packets (emergency, science, log) should be transmitted first.

The prototype is implemented in Python and available as notebook (`.ipynb`).
